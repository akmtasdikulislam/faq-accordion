## My process

- At first, I linked the `style.css` file and the Google Fonts CDN with `index.html`.
- Then, imported the colors from `style-guide.md` into the `style.css` file. After that, I initialized the css file and set necessary parameters (such as, font-families, colours, font-sizes etc.) for this project.
- Then, I wrote necessary code to reach the given _UI Design Sample_ and also added necessary css styles to match it with the _UI Design Sample_.
- After that, I wrote the necessary CSS MEDIA QUERIES for mobile device view of this project.
- Finally, I wrote necessary `javascript` codes to toggle open/close state when an accordio is **clicked**.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By doing this project I learned how to use javascript to create a toggle open/close for an accordion to show its contents.

### Useful resources

- [[JavaScript] - How to create an Accordion with JavaScript resource 1](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/9202-how-to-create-an-accordion-with-javascript#:~:text=The%20JavaScript%20code%20adds%20a,class%2C%20which%20opens%20its%20content.) - This helped me to add toggle open/close feature to accordions.
- [PerfectPixel by WellDoneCode](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) - This extension helped me to match the UI Design Sample as close as possible.
